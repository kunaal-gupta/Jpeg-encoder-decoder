## JPEG Encoder Decoder


## Part 1 (60%): JPEG encoding
In this part, JPEG encoder is implemented on the input image. 
The JPEG encoder section has three major steps: 

1. Creating a 2D discrete cosine transform (DCT) function called dct2D
2. Quantization: Process of removing the high-frequency data. You can read more about quantization here. NOTE: Refer to this PDF and use Fig. 10 (c) (Page 12) as your quantization matrix
3. Degree of compression: The calculation for the degree of compression requires computing the number of pixel locations with zero values before and after quantization over the multiple blocks. You need to calculate the percentage of zero-pixel locations.


##  Part 2 (40%): JPEG decoding

In this part, JPEG decoder is implemented on the input image. 
The JPEG decoder section has two major steps:

1. Creating a 2D discrete cosine transform (DCT) function called idct2D
2. De-quantization
